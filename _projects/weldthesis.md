This project involved the integration of a welding system into a pre-owned 6-axis UR10e robotic arm by Universal Robots. Compatible components were sourced, including a wire feeder, power supply and control module from Miller and a Tregaskiss MIG gun as an end effector. The aquired components were integrated with custom circuit design into the overall system programmed in ROS and Python. The scope of this project included weld order optimization and control, human-robot collaborative part matching and weld selection, and empirical exercises to find desirable operating perameters for wire feed rate, robotic arm speed, voltage and more.
