Due to a NDA I will not disclose the entirity of this research project. However, it did involve testing a novel method for cooling CPU's in data centers with jet impingement surface cooling.
During this project I worked with graduate students to develop single investigator skills. My contributions to this project were aiding in the development of pressure drop models, experimental apparatuses, overiding servers' onboard fans to measure cooling effectiveness and more. Infact, I was first introduced to linux and BASH when I had to cycle test the CPU's for this project. I also utilized an osciloscope to probe the circuit in order to override the fan speed with a custom controlled PWM. It was fortanate that I qualified for this advanced research based course as a undergrad because it instilled the passion I have today for research.
