Although this project happened a long time ago, I am still very proud of it. This course in mechatronics inspired me to pursue my passions in robotics, controls, mechatronics and more.
Further, becuase of the success in our project we were able to place in the top 3 best projects for the class. I was fortunate enough to be able to spearhead both the circuit design and integration as it was a fantastic learning experience.
